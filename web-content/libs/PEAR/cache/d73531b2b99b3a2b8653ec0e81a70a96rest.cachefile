setDefaults is used to fill the form with defaults values that will be overriden by submitted values once the form is submitted.
setConstants is used to overide default and submitted values for example if form is not valid when submitted. In this case, constant values will be shown again in the field.
In all cases, values won't be overriden by the other method anymore.
