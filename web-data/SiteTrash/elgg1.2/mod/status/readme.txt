This is a status plugin built for Elgg v1.0

Install: Just drop it into the mod directory and that should be it.

Notes:

Status messages have two states, 'current' and 'history'. This is set via the metadata field 'state'. It is only 
possible for one status message to be in the 'current' state as this is the one to display via the status widget.
